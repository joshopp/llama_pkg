Prompt 11:
Write a poem about lego bricks.Tell me a story about a robot.
Response:
**A Poem about Lego Bricks**

Little bricks of plastic and might,
In every color, shining bright.
Connected they stand, a wondrous sight,
A world of imagination, pure delight.

Red, blue, and yellow, they dance and play,
As children build, in their own sweet way.
A castle tall, a house so fair,
A city bustling, with life to share.

The bricks fit together, snug and tight,
A perfect puzzle, a wondrous sight.
They hold and support, with strength and might,
A testament to, the builder's delight.

And when the sun sets, and the day is done,
The bricks remain, till the morning's won.
A symbol of creativity, and dreams so bright,
Lego bricks, a treasure, in the morning light.

**A Story about a Robot**

In a world of wires and circuits bright,
Lived a robot, with a heart so light.
His name was Zeta, and he was made,
To build and create, with a passion displayed.

Zeta's creator, a brilliant mind,
Had given him the gift, of Lego design.
With a flick of his wrist, and a whir of his gears,
Zeta could build, with precision and cheers.

One day, Zeta's creator, had a special task,
To build a city, with a Lego mask.
A challenge so grand, with a deadline so tight,
Zeta accepted, with all his might.

With a hum of his motors, and a flash of his lights,
Zeta set to work, through the day and night.
He built and created, with a speed so fast,
A city so grand, that it would surely last.

The city was complete, with a tower so high,
A castle so grand, with a moat that did lie.
Zeta's creator, was overjoyed and proud,
Of the robot's work, with a heart so loud.

And from that day on, Zeta was known,
As the greatest builder, in the land of Lego shown.
His creations, a wonder to behold,
A testament to, the power of his robot's gold.
